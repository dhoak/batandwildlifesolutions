									<h4>ATTIC RESTORATION</h4>
									<p>Bats, birds, raccoons and all other wildlife can wreck havoc in your attic space 
									once granted access. An attic restoration is an important measure to take once these 
									critters have been removed to prevent health risks to you or your loved ones. There is 
									always the potential for histoplasmosis from bat or bird droppings. If your attic space 
									needs a full restoration we will remove all insulation, sanitize re-insulate, all up to 
									the building code for your area. The removal of waste will be treated the same as any 
									other hazardous material situation. Our technicians will wear respirators and boot covers, 
									we will also plastic off areas and if needed use air scrubbers to pull any pollutants out 
									of the air. The waste will then be removed by a high powered vacuum through a hose, emptying 
									into a HEPA filtered bag outside or with a 45 gallon air tight construction bag. The 
									insulation is almost always removed through an open gable vent or window closest to the 
									attic, only in rare and extreme circumstances would we transport the bags through the home. 
									After your attic space is cleaner, we then sanitize it with a portable atomizer to kill off 
									any fungi or bacteria that may be present. Last, but not least, we reapply new insulation with 
									the correct R Value to code. We offer a wide range of insulating options.</p>

									<h4>HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE</h4>
									<p>Attic restorations can become a great expense due to the work and materials involved. The 
									damages to your home by a nocturnal mammal may be covered under your Homeowners Insurance policy. 
									We work with insurance providers on a daily basis providing them all the information needed to 
									cover your restoration. If your restoration is not able to be covered under your insurance, we 
									will work with your budget to find a plan that fits.</p>
