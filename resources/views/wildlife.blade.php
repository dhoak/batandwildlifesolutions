									<h4>GROUNDHOGS</h4>
									<p>The groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, are well adapted for digging with short 
									and powerful limbs and thick curved claws. They are a nuisance, mainly digging around 
									sheds, under decks and loosening stones around boulder walls. They can live for up to 
									six years, being mostly herbivorous eating wild grasses and other vegetation. Groundhogs 
									are one of the few species that enters into a true hibernation during the winter months. 
									They birth between 2-6 young around April-May and the young groundhogs leave their mother 
									around 5-6 weeks of age.</p>

									<h4>RACCOONS</h4>
									<p>Raccoons are noted for the intelligence in remember the solution to tasks for up to 3 
									years! Due to their adaptability and approaching urban areas, some homeowners consider them 
									pests as they find their way inside attic spaces. The young, also known as “kits,” are born 
									in the spring making this the time homeowners usually begin to notice a problem. Raccoons 
									birth 2-5 young and these kit stay with their mother until the fall. Raccoons can carry 
									rabies and also leave a nasty mess behind from urine and feces. For more information on an 
									attic clean up, check out our attic restoration page.</p>

									<h4>SKUNKS</h4>
									<p>Skunks are known for their ability to spray liquid with a strong odor. They are omnivorous 
									and very commonly seek out garbage left by humans. Skunks dig holes, getting under decks and 
									causing a smelly problem, which is why it's a good idea to trap and relocate them. They 
									usually give birth to 5-6 young in May. Skunks can carry rabies, although it is rare for them 
									to bite a human.</p>

									<h4>OPOSSUMS</h4>
									<p>Opossums are marsupials with a flexible diet. They have reproductive habits that colonizers 
									and easy survivors in diverse locations and conditions. Opossums are nocturnal animals, they 
									favor dark and secure locations, typically under decks or in crawl spaces within the home. Any 
									mammal can carry rabies, but due to their low body temperature (94-97°F,) it makes it difficult 
									for the virus to survive.</p>

									<h4>SQUIRRELS</h4>
									<p>FOX SQUIRRELS usually are observed in yards or traveling electric lines. They are the largest 
									tree squirrel found in Michigan, usually a cinnamon color with a tan belly. Fox squirrels aren't 
									big chewers and take advantage of preexisting holes or damage to gain access to a home.</p>

									<p>GRAY SQUIRRELS are smaller than fox squirrels and color varies between black and gray. They 
									spend most of their lives in trees or backyards.</p>

									<p>RED SQUIRRELS are smaller in size at about 12-15 inches from nose to tail. They tend to be a 
									solid reddish brown with a light/white belly. These little guys can wreck havoc chewing at eaves 
									or gable vents getting into attics to nest.</p>

									<p>NORTHERN FLYING SQUIRRELS are rarely seen due to their nocturnal habits. They have a flattened 
									tail and excess skin that they use to glide from on tree to another. They will also chew round 
									holes to gain access to attics and walls, causing a racket during night hours.</p>

									<p>CHIPMUNKS are a small ground squirrel. Reddish brown with a white stripe down their back bordered 
									with two black stripes. Chipmunks are usually just an annoyance with loud chirping and tunnels dug 
									through flower gardens.</p>

									<h4>MICE</h4>
									<p>Mice are small mammals with a painted snout, rounded ears and a long almost hairless tail. The 
									females give to a litter of 3-14 young. One female can have 5-10 litters per year, so the population 
									can increase very quickly. They are often found in basements, where food is kept or trying to keep 
									warm in attics during winter months.</p>

									<h4>BIRDS</h4>
									<p>PIGEONS will be found roosting on roofs or causing a serious mess around commercial buildings in 
									rafters or docking areas. We offer numerous solutions for prevention and clean up.</p>

									<p>CHIMNEY SWIFTS are incapable of perching and can only cling vertically to surfaces. They build 
									bracket nests almost always within a human-built structure, usually chimneys. They tend to have 
									babies near the end of May, around this time you may hear an annoying sound coming from your chimney.</p>

									<p>STARLINGS are typically dark with a metallic sheen and a yellow beak. Most nest in holes or find 
									their way into residential exhaust fans or openings. They lay blue or white eggs are can be an annoyance 
									to homeowners. We offer a variety of clean-up and deterrent options.</p>

									<p>SPARROWS are generally small, plump birds which makes it easy for them to enter though construction 
									gaps in eaves of homes. They will build nests in soffits and attic spaces. We often seal entry points 
									to bird proof your home and prevent them from gaining future access.</p>
